stuff I made for a project in a computer graphics class last year, putting it here so i can toss it up on github.io (you can find that [here](https://adrianmgg.github.io/computer-graphics-homework-mar-thing/))

code in `lib/`was helper stuff provided for the class, the rest is written by me unless specified otherwise. i haven't looked over this code in moths and it was written pretty rushed, so i wouldn't suggest using this as reference for how to do stuff correctly
